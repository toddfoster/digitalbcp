# Digital BCP

A sandbox for experiments/learning.

## Quick start
Clone the git repo
Run build.py to regenerate index.html
Modify build.py and src/bcp10.txt to improve the accuracy of the text / formatting

## Contributing
Contributions welcome. Fork, modify, issue a pull request. My biggest initial concerns are:

## To Do
* Clean up bcp10.txt (renaming it) -- convert to markdown?
* Remove/modify header per instructinos
* A stylesheet to recreate the appearance of the real BCP as nearly as possible
* Navigation by swiping
* Floating navigation bar
* Links (TOC in navigation bar, page selector)
* About with license (CC) and credits (page 0, only accessible via direct link)

## License
Base text:
   This file, which should be called BCP10.TXT or bcp10.txt, is in the 
   PUBLIC DOMAIN.  You may make copies, distribute them, produce derivative 
   works, reformat, and make extracts from it.  If you do so, please do not 
   distribute this header along with your altered E-text.

Header also states: "the text itself is guaranteed to be in the Public Domain by Canon Law"

I need to go find an appropriate license. Probably one of the looser Creative Commons licenses. I intend that my work (and any that should happen to be contributed to me) should be free to use and modify.
