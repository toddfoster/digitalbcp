# Digital BCP

A sandbox for experiments/learning



## Quick start
Clone the git repo
Run build.py to regenerate index.html
Modify build.py and src/bcp10.txt to improve the accuracy of the text / formatting


## Contributing
Contributions welcome. Fork, modify, issue a pull request. My biggest initial concerns are:


## To Do
* Clean up bcp10.txt (renaming it)
* A stylesheet to recreate the appearance of the real BCP as nearly as possible
* Navigation by swiping
* Links (TOC in navigation bar, page selector)
* About with license (CC) and credits
